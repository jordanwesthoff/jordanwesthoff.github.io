## Senior Thesis GitHub Wiki, RIT 2014, Jordan Westhoff

This wiki will contain several parts; each dedicated to a separate portion of the project as it would be managed from this wiki. This is the official public front end for information, task lists, time frames and other pertinent information to the progression of the project.

The official goal of the project is to develop and engineer a system that can ingest RAW 4K digital content and process it in real time through the power of distributed and high powered, clustered computing. Hardware engineering will take place outside of this wiki, but all software and project management information will be hosted here where it is publicly available to be viewed. For more information about the scope and goals of the project, as well as more informative and less technical updates please visit [my webite](http://jordanwesthoff.com/about/senior-thesis-project-rit-b-s/) for a comprehensive page.

All scripts and code are being developed in their own repositories and will be added to this repository once they are completed. All information in this wiki and the attached repositories are available for use by the public with credit to the author (myself). BE WARNED: No proprietary or mission critical code will be hosted in the attached repository, as it will be copyrighted. All of the code so far is filed under the GNU/GPL and is open to public use.
